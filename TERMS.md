**Contact:** support@fleming.ai  
**Jurisdictions:** Republic of India, United Kingdom, European Union  
**Primary data authority (project phase):** MeitY (India)

## 1. Scope and Nature of Service
Fleming provides **general health information** and triage guidance based on public clinical guidelines. Fleming **does not** provide medical diagnosis, prescriptions, or treatment, and does **not** replace advice from a qualified clinician or emergency services.

## 2. Emergencies
If we detect possible emergency symptoms, we will advise you to call local emergency services (India: **112**). If you decline emergency advice and continue using the service, **you agree that Fleming and its providers are not responsible for outcomes** resulting from failure to seek urgent care.

## 3. Doctor Directory and Consults
The “Talk to a doctor” feature lists practitioners with details such as years of experience, workplace, and languages. Profiles may be marked **“Not yet verified.”** Free and paid consults may be offered. Payments (when enabled) are processed by third parties; we do not store card data on our servers.

## 4. User Accounts and Age
Sign-in uses phone number with one-time password (OTP). Users under 18 should use the service **with a guardian’s supervision** and should not rely on it as a substitute for pediatric care.

## 5. Content and References
Advice is grounded in public clinical guidelines (e.g., ICMR, AIIMS, NICE). Citations are provided via a “Show references” option. Summaries may not capture individual circumstances and should be reviewed with a clinician when needed.

## 6. Privacy and Data Handling
- **Data collected:** chat transcripts, triage responses, service metadata; optional health basics (age group, sex at birth, chronic conditions, allergies).
- **Retention (project phase):** chats and summaries up to **180 days**; payment data per processor; export/delete on request.
- **Storage:** India users in `ap-south-1` (Mumbai); UK users in `eu-west-2` (London). Only **de-identified analytics** may be centrally aggregated.
- **Security:** encryption in transit and at rest, role-based access, and audit logging; access restricted to authorized personnel on a need-to-know basis.

## 7. Acceptable Use
Do not use the service for unlawful purposes or to seek prescriptions, emergency care, or toxicology instructions. We may restrict access for abuse or security concerns.

## 8. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability
The service is provided “**as is**” without warranties. Fleming is not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages. Our aggregate liability is limited to the greater of INR 1,000 or the amount you paid in the prior 3 months (if any).

## 9. Changes
We may update these terms and the privacy notice. Continued use indicates acceptance of the updated version.
